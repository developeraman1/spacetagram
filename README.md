# NASA APOD Viewer

A simple project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

This is my **first project using Next.js**, and I built it to learn how Next.js works â€” especially routing, server-side rendering, and API integration.

## Features

- Fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA
- Clean UI with minimal styling
- Uses `next/image` for image optimization
- Responsive and accessible

## Learning Phase

> I'm still learning Next.js â€” this is an amateur project and a work in progress.  
> **I would love feedback** or suggestions on how to improve it!


## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript 
- NASA APOD API
